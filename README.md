## 📊 Simple GDP Growth Projections

> "Where's the Simple Data on India's GDP Growth?"

Every few months, we hear bold claims:
- "India will be a $5 trillion economy by 2027!"
- "We'll surpass Germany and Japan in GDP by 2035!"
- "Fastest-growing major economy!"

But when you try to understand the actual numbers, you get lost in:
- GDP projections from IMF, World Bank, RBI—each with different numbers
- Complicated reports filled with terms like real GDP, nominal GDP, fiscal year growth
- No simple visual representation to quickly grasp where we're headed
